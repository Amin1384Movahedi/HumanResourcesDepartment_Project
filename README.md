When running a business, it takes money to make money. You make spending decisions every day for the betterment of your company, and one of the most important decisions is people. <br />

The cost of hiring an employee is arguably one of the most expensive parts of running a business. While that may seem scary, people are the key enabler to business growth and performance, so hiring new employees is a super-exciting process.<br />

In this article, we’ll look at the true cost of hiring an employee. Once we’ve run through the common cost areas to think about, we’ll look at how to tie those costs together and optimize your total investment. <br />
